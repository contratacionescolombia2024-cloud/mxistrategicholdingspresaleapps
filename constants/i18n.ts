15. MXI TOKEN USE POLICY

The MXI token is a digital asset in pre-launch stage, without commercial value, without public listing and without recognition as legal tender in Colombia, Spain, Mexico or any other jurisdiction. Its use within the platform is exclusively functional, intended for internal rewards, participation in gamified activities and access to benefits of the MXI ecosystem.

MXI does not represent investments, property rights, guaranteed profitability, equity participation, financial instruments, negotiable securities or similar products. Users accept that the use of the token is experimental, subject to changes and dependent on technical and regulatory validation processes.

Any future value, convertibility or listing of the token will depend on conditions external to the company, regulatory processes and market decisions that cannot be guaranteed. The platform does not ensure economic benefits, appreciation or any return associated with MXI.

16. LEGAL ANNEX – MXI GAMES AND REWARDS

The dynamics available within the platform (including challenges, mini-games such as tap, clicker, "AirBall", skill challenges and the "Bonus MXI" modality) are based exclusively on the user's skill, speed, precision or active participation, and do not depend on chance to determine results.

No activity offered should be interpreted as:

- game of chance,
- bet,
- raffle for profit,
- regulated raffles,
- state or private lotteries,
- nor equivalent mechanisms regulated in Colombia, Spain or Mexico.

Access to these dynamics may require a symbolic payment in MXI, but such payment does not constitute a bet, since the token has no real economic value and is used only as an internal participation mechanism.

The "Bonus MXI" modality, including random prize allocation, is carried out outside the main platform, through independent, transparent and verifiable processes, whose purpose is to distribute promotional rewards in MXI without this constituting a regulated game of chance.

Users accept that the rewards granted are promotional, digital and without commercial value, and that participation in any dynamic does not guarantee real economic gains.

**IMPORTANT**: These terms and conditions are legally binding. If you do not agree with any part, you should not use the Application. It is recommended to consult with a legal or financial advisor before making investments in cryptocurrencies.

Each service feeds the ecosystem, avoiding dependence on new buyers to sustain the economy.',
    sustainabilityDecentralized: '🌍 Additionally, the decentralized approach allows the community to drive key decisions, creating an adaptable, self-sufficient system resistant to external crises.

    // Vesting Diario Tab Content - NEW CONTENT
    vestingDiarioIntro: 'Daily Vesting is a mechanism designed to protect the stability of the project during the presale and, at the same time, provide investors with a fair, predictable, and sustainable way to receive their tokens. Instead of releasing all tokens immediately—which usually generates drastic drops due to massive sales—MXI distributes allocations progressively, balanced, and transparently.',
    vestingDiarioHowItWorks: 'From the moment a user acquires MXI in presale, their total balance is recorded in a smart contract that manages daily release. Every 24 hours, a predefined percentage of the total purchased is released automatically, allowing the user to withdraw it, transfer it, or use it within the ecosystem. This process ensures that all participants have gradual access to their tokens without saturating the market, while the project advances in development, user growth, financial services integration, and ecosystem expansion.',
    vestingDiarioBenefits: 'The goal is to create a natural balance between supply and demand, which strengthens the token valuation and benefits early investors with a sustainable model.',
    vestingDiarioTransparency: 'Additionally, daily vesting is part of MXI\'s commitment to transparency: each release can be audited on the blockchain, and users maintain total control over their token flow without depending on intermediaries.',
    vestingDiarioSummaryTitle: 'In summary, daily vesting is a tool designed to:',
    vestingDiarioBenefit1: '🛡️ Protect the token value and avoid abrupt drops.',
    vestingDiarioBenefit2: '📈 Accompany the real growth of the ecosystem.',
    vestingDiarioBenefit3: '🤝 Create equality among investors in the initial stage.',
    vestingDiarioBenefit4: '🔍 Guarantee traceability and security in each release.',
    vestingDiarioBenefit5: '🔄 Offer progressive liquidity without compromising sustainability.',

    howItWorksIntro: '🚀 MXI functions as an expanding ecosystem designed to grow in phases, ensuring that each stage drives the next. Today we are in presale, the earliest and most strategic phase of the project, where the first participants gain early access to the token before its full integration into the system.',
    step1Title: '1️⃣ Early Token Acquisition (Presale)',
    step1Description: 'During this stage, users purchase MAXCoin (MXI) at preferential prices (0.40, 0.70, and 1.00 USDT). These tokens are not released all at once: they enter an automated vesting system that guarantees stability and controlled distribution.',
    step2Title: '2️⃣ Smart Daily Vesting',
    step2Description: 'Acquired tokens are released through a Daily Vesting of 3% monthly, calculated and released minute by minute. This mechanism ensures three things:\n\n• Progressive circulation\n• Market protection\n• Greater price sustainability\n\nIn other words, you receive your tokens constantly and predictably without saturating the supply.',
    step3Title: '3️⃣ Active Ecosystem Under Construction',
    step3Description: 'While users receive MXI, the team develops and integrates core components:\n\n• MXI App: balance management, vesting, expansion network, and internal tools\n• Skill Tournaments: rewards generated by real participation\n• MXI Pay: instant conversion payment system\n• MXI Card: will allow you to use your balance at any compatible merchant\n• Quantum Security: post-quantum algorithms that shield transactions and keys\n\nAll of this is activated in stages as the presale is completed.',
    step4Title: '4️⃣ Market Entry and Expansion Phase',
    step4Description: 'Once the presale ends and the app is in full operation, MXI begins its growth cycle:\n\n• Daily token utility\n• Merchant integration\n• Internal marketplace\n• International expansion\n• Future migration to its own blockchain\n\nThis is key: valuation is driven by use, not speculation.\n\n✨ MXI functions as a living system: it allows you to enter early, receive your token in an orderly manner, and accompany the growth of an ecosystem designed to scale in the coming months.',

    // Risks Tab Content - NEW CONTENT
    risksIntro: 'Investing in MXI represents an innovative opportunity within an ecosystem designed for real growth, but it also involves harmful risks that every investor must consider responsibly. MXI promotes transparency, so we detail the key factors that can influence the present and future profitability of the project.',
    risk1Title: '1. Market Volatility Risk',
    risk1Description: 'The crypto market is highly volatile. Although MXI integrates a hybrid tokenomic model that seeks stability through daily vesting, liquidity mechanisms and scalable rewards, the price can fluctuate significantly due to global conditions, market sentiment or unexpected events. The projected launch value (3 USDT) is an estimate, not a guarantee.',
    risk2Title: '2. Technological Risk',
    risk2Description: 'Despite MXI incorporating post-quantum quantum security and advanced architecture, no digital ecosystem is completely free of vulnerabilities. Protocol failures, external attacks or new technological threats could affect operability. Quantum implementation minimizes future scenarios, but does not eliminate risks 100%.',
    risk3Title: '3. Project Execution Risk',
    risk3Description: 'MXI is in the prevention phase and, like any project in development, depends on the correct execution of the technical plan, implementation times, community adoption and consolidation of strategic alliances. Delays or restructuring can impact goals and projections.',
    risk4Title: '4. Regulatory Risk',
    risk4Description: 'The global regulatory environment regarding crypto assets is changing. Changes in laws of key countries, greater compliance requirements or restrictions on exchanges can influence the liquidity, accessibility or price of the token.',
    risk5Title: '5. Liquidity Risk',
    risk5Description: 'Although MXI integrates a progressive liquidity model and tools that encourage holding (daily vesting, rewards, referrals), in initial stages liquidity may be limited. This could make immediate sales at the desired price difficult.',
    risk6Title: '6. Ecosystem Adoption Risk',
    risk6Description: 'The potential of MXI grows as the community strengthens and use within the ecosystem increases (card, credits, tools for entrepreneurs, Marketplaces, Launchpad, energy, global expansion, etc.). Slower adoption could prolong token appreciation times.',
    risk7Title: '7. Competitive Risk',
    risk7Description: 'MXI competes in a market where highly positioned projects exist (BTC, ETH, SOL, ADA). Although the hybrid model, dynamic vesting and quantum security represent differential advantages, competitor advances could affect potential market share.',
    risk8Title: '8. Community Dependence Risk',
    risk8Description: 'MXI is based on a fundamental principle: if the community grows, everyone grows. This means that part of the success depends on the participation, commitment and expansion of users, project issuers, entrepreneurs and investors. Low participation would limit global projections.',
    risk9Title: '9. Early Investment Risk',
    risk9Description: 'As in all prevention, investors acquire the token before the ecosystem is fully deployed. Although this offers price advantages (0.04 / 0.07 / 0.10 USDT), it also carries the natural uncertainty of the initial stages.',

15. POLÍTICA DE USO DEL TOKEN MXI

El token MXI es un activo digital en etapa de prelanzamiento, sin valor comercial, sin cotización pública y sin reconocimiento como moneda de curso legal en Colombia, España, México ni en ninguna otra jurisdicción. Su uso dentro de la plataforma es exclusivamente funcional, destinado a recompensas internas, participación en actividades gamificadas y acceso a beneficios del ecosistema MXI.

MXI no representa inversiones, derechos de propiedad, rentabilidad garantizada, participación accionaria, instrumentos financieros, valores negociables ni productos similares. Los usuarios aceptan que el uso del token es experimental, sujeto a cambios y dependiente de procesos de validación técnica y regulatoria.

Cualquier futuro valor, convertibilidad o listado del token dependerá de condiciones externas a la compañía, procesos regulatorios y decisiones de mercado que no pueden garantizarse. La plataforma no asegura beneficios económicos, apreciación ni rendimiento alguno asociado al MXI.

16. ANEXO LEGAL – JUEGOS Y RECOMPENSAS MXI

Las dinámicas disponibles dentro de la plataforma (incluyendo retos, minijuegos como tap, clicker, "AirBall", desafíos de habilidad y la modalidad "Bonus MXI") se basan exclusivamente en la destreza, rapidez, precisión o participación activa del usuario, y no dependen del azar para determinar resultados.

Ninguna actividad ofrecida debe interpretarse como:

- juego de azar,
- apuesta,
- sorteo con fines lucrativos,
- rifas reguladas,
- loterías estatales o privadas,
- ni mecanismos equivalentes regulados en Colombia, España o México.

El acceso a estas dinámicas puede requerir un pago simbólico en MXI, pero dicho pago no constituye una apuesta, ya que el token no posee valor económico real y se utiliza únicamente como mecanismo interno de participación.

La modalidad "Bonus MXI", incluyendo asignación aleatoria de premios, se realiza fuera de la plataforma principal, mediante procesos independientes, transparentes y verificables, cuyo fin es distribuir recompensas promocionales en MXI sin que ello constituya un juego de azar regulado.

Los usuarios aceptan que las recompensas otorgadas son promocionales, digitales y sin valor comercial, y que la participación en cualquier dinámica no garantiza ganancias económicas reales.

---

**IMPORTANTE**: Estos términos y condiciones son legalmente vinculantes. Si no está de acuerdo con alguna parte, no debe utilizar la Aplicación. Se recomienda consultar con un asesor legal o financiero antes de realizar inversiones en criptomonedas.

A diferencia de proyectos especulativos, MXI incorpora servicios que generan movimiento constante del token: pagos, marketplace, préstamos, staking, tarjeta, herramientas para emprendedores y programas de valor compartido. Cada servicio alimenta al ecosistema, evitando la dependencia de nuevos compradores para sostener la economía.',
    sustainabilityDecentralized: '🌍 Además, el enfoque descentralizado permite que la comunidad impulse decisiones clave, creando un sistema adaptable, autosuficiente y resistente a crisis externas.

    // Vesting Diario Tab Content - NEW CONTENT
    vestingDiarioIntro: 'El Vesting Diario es un mecanismo diseñado para proteger la estabilidad del proyecto durante la preventa y, al mismo tiempo, brindar a los inversionistas una forma justa, predecible y sostenible de recibir sus tokens. En lugar de liberar todos los tokens de inmediato —lo que suele generar caídas drásticas por ventas masivas— MXI distribuye las asignaciones de forma progresiva, equilibrada y transparente.',
    vestingDiarioHowItWorks: 'Desde el momento en que un usuario adquiere MXI en preventa, su saldo total queda registrado en un contrato inteligente que administra la liberación diaria. Cada 24 horas, un porcentaje predefinido del total comprado se libera de forma automática, permitiendo al usuario retirarlo, transferirlo o usarlo dentro del ecosistema. Este proceso garantiza que todos los participantes tengan acceso gradual a sus tokens sin saturar el mercado, mientras el proyecto avanza en desarrollo, crecimiento de usuarios, integración de servicios financieros y expansión del ecosistema.',
    vestingDiarioBenefits: 'El objetivo es crear un equilibrio natural entre oferta y demanda, lo que fortalece la valoración del token y beneficia a los primeros inversores con un modelo sostenible.',
    vestingDiarioTransparency: 'Además, el vesting diario es parte del compromiso de MXI con la transparencia: cada liberación puede auditarse en la blockchain, y los usuarios mantienen el control total sobre su flujo de tokens sin depender de intermediarios.',
    vestingDiarioSummaryTitle: 'En resumen, el vesting diario es una herramienta diseñada para:',
    vestingDiarioBenefit1: '🛡️ Proteger el valor del token y evitar caídas abruptas.',
    vestingDiarioBenefit2: '📈 Acompañar el crecimiento real del ecosistema.',

    vestingDiarioBenefit4: '🔍 Garantizar trazabilidad y seguridad en cada liberación.',
    vestingDiarioBenefit5: '🔄 Ofrecer liquidez progresiva sin comprometer la sostenibilidad.',

    howItWorksIntro: '🚀 MXI funciona como un ecosistema en expansión diseñado para crecer por fases, asegurando que cada etapa impulse la siguiente. Hoy nos encontramos en preventa, la fase más temprana y estratégica del proyecto, donde los primeros participantes obtienen acceso anticipado al token antes de su integración total en el sistema.',
    step1Title: '1️⃣ Adquisición Temprana del Token (Preventa)',
    step1Description: 'Durante esta etapa, los usuarios compran MAXCoin (MXI) a precios preferenciales (0.40, 0.70 y 1.00 USDT). Estos tokens no se liberan todos de inmediato: entran en un sistema automatizado de vesting que garantiza estabilidad y distribución controlada.',
    step2Title: '2️⃣ Vesting Diario Inteligente',
    step2Description: 'Los tokens adquiridos se liberan mediante un Vesting Diario del 3% mensual, calculado y liberado minuto a minuto. Este mecanismo asegura tres cosas:\n\n• Circulación progresiva\n• Protección del mercado\n• Mayor sostenibilidad del precio\n\nEn otras palabras, recibes tus tokens de forma constante y predecible sin saturar la oferta.',
    step3Title: '3️⃣ Ecosistema en Construcción Activa',
    step3Description: 'Mientras los usuarios reciben MXI, el equipo desarrolla e integra los componentes centrales:\n\n• MXI App: gestión de saldos, vesting, red de expansión y herramientas internas\n• Torneos de habilidad: recompensas generadas por participación real\n• MXI Pay: sistema de pagos con conversión instantánea\n• Tarjeta MXI: que te permitirá usar tu saldo en cualquier comercio compatible\n• Seguridad Cuántica: algoritmos post-cuánticos que blindan transacciones y claves\n\nTodo esto se activa por etapas conforme se completa la preventa.',
    step4Title: '4️⃣ Entrada a Mercado y Fase de Expansión',
    step4Description: 'Una vez la preventa finalice y la app esté en operación completa, MXI inicia su ciclo de crecimiento:\n\n• Utilidad diaria del token\n• Integración con comercios\n• Marketplace interno\n• Expansión internacional\n• Futura migración a su propio blockchain\n\nEsto es clave: la valorización se impulsa por uso, no por especulación.\n\n✨ MXI funciona como un sistema vivo: te permite entrar temprano, recibir tu token de forma ordenada y acompañar el crecimiento de un ecosistema diseñado para escalar en los próximos meses.',

    risksIntro: 'Invertir en MXI representa una oportunidad innovadora dentro de un ecosistema diseñado para el crecimiento real, pero también implica riesgos perjudiciales que todo inversor debe considerar de manera responsable. MXI promueve la transparencia, por lo que detallamos los factores clave que pueden influir en la rentabilidad presente y futura del proyecto.',
    risk1Title: '1. Riesgo de Volatilidad del Mercado',
    risk1Description: 'El mercado cripto es altamente volátil. Aunque MXI integra un modelo tokenómico híbrido que busca estabilidad mediante vesting diario, mecanismos de liquidez y recompensas escalables, el precio puede fluctuar significativamente ante condiciones globales, sentimiento del mercado o eventos inesperados. El valor proyectado de lanzamiento (3 USDT) es una estimación, no una garantía.',
    risk2Title: '2. Riesgo Tecnológico',
    risk2Description: 'A pesar de que MXI incorpora seguridad cuántica post-cuántica y arquitectura avanzada, ningún ecosistema digital está completamente libre de vulnerabilidades. Fallos en protocolos, ataques externos o nuevas amenazas tecnológicas podrían afectar la operatividad. La implementación cuántica minimiza escenarios futuros, pero no elimina los riesgos al 100%.',
    risk3Title: '3. Riesgo de Ejecución del Proyecto',
    risk3Description: 'MXI está en fase de prevención y, como todo proyecto en desarrollo, depende de la correcta ejecución del plan técnico, los tiempos de implementación, la adopción comunitaria y la consolidación de alianzas estratégicas. Retrasos o reestructuraciones pueden impactar metas y proyecciones.',
    risk4Title: '4. Riesgo Regulatorio',
    risk4Description: 'El entorno normativo global respecto a criptoactivos es cambiante. Cambios en leyes de países clave, mayores exigencias de cumplimiento o restricciones a intercambios pueden influir en la liquidez, accesibilidad o precio del token.',
    risk5Title: '5. Riesgo de Liquidez',
    risk5Description: 'Aunque MXI integra un modelo de liquidez progresivo y herramientas que incentivan el holding (vesting diario, recompensas, referidos), en etapas iniciales la liquidez puede ser limitada. Esto podría dificultar ventas inmediatas al precio deseado.',
    risk6Title: '6. Riesgo de Adopción del Ecosistema',
    risk6Description: 'El potencial de MXI crece a medida que se fortalece la comunidad y aumenta el uso dentro del ecosistema (tarjeta, créditos, herramientas para emprendedores, Marketplaces, Launchpad, energía, expansión global, etc.). Una adopción más lenta podría prolongar los tiempos de apreciación del token.',
    risk7Title: '7. Riesgo Competitivo',
    risk7Description: 'MXI compite en un mercado donde existen proyectos altamente posicionados (BTC, ETH, SOL, ADA). Aunque el modelo híbrido, el vesting dinámico y la seguridad cuántica representan ventajas diferenciales, los avances de los competidores podrían afectar la cuota de mercado potencial.',
    risk8Title: '8. Riesgo de Dependencia Comunitaria',
    risk8Description: 'MXI se basa en un principio fundamental: si la comunidad crece, todos crecen. Esto significa que parte del éxito depende de la participación, compromiso y expansión de usuarios, emisores de proyectos, emprendedores e inversores. La baja participación limitaría las proyecciones globales.',
    risk9Title: '9. Riesgo de Inversión Temprana',
    risk9Description: 'Como en toda prevención, los inversores adquieren el token antes de que el ecosistema esté completamente desplegado. Aunque esto ofrece ventajas en precio (0.04 / 0.07 / 0.10 USDT), también conlleva la incertidumbre natural de las etapas iniciales.',

15. POLÍTICA DE USO DO TOKEN MXI

O token MXI é um ativo digital em estágio de pré-lançamento, sem valor comercial, sem cotação pública e sem reconhecimento como moeda de curso legal na Colômbia, Espanha, México ou em qualquer outra jurisdição. Seu uso dentro da plataforma é exclusivamente funcional, destinado a recompensas internas, participação em atividades gamificadas e acesso a benefícios do ecossistema MXI.

MXI não representa investimentos, direitos de propriedade, rentabilidade garantida, participação acionária, instrumentos financeiros, valores negociáveis ou produtos similares. Os usuários aceitam que o uso do token é experimental, sujeito a mudanças e dependente de processos de validação técnica e regulatória.

Qualquer valor futuro, convertibilidade ou listagem do token dependerá de condições externas à empresa, processos regulatórios e decisões de mercado que não podem ser garantidas. A plataforma não garante benefícios econômicos, apreciação ou qualquer retorno associado ao MXI.

16. ANEXO LEGAL – JOGOS E RECOMPENSAS MXI

As dinâmicas disponíveis dentro da plataforma (incluindo desafios, mini-jogos como tap, clicker, "AirBall", desafios de habilidade e a modalidade "Bonus MXI") são baseadas exclusivamente na habilidade, velocidade, precisão ou participação ativa do usuário, e não dependem do acaso para determinar resultados.

Nenhuma atividade oferecida deve ser interpretada como:

- jogo de azar,
- aposta,
- sorteio com fins lucrativos,
- rifas reguladas,
- loterias estatais ou privadas,
- nem mecanismos equivalentes regulados na Colômbia, Espanha ou México.

O acesso a essas dinâmicas pode exigir um pagamento simbólico em MXI, mas tal pagamento não constitui uma aposta, já que o token não possui valor econômico real e é usado apenas como mecanismo interno de participação.

A modalidade "Bonus MXI", incluindo alocação aleatória de prêmios, é realizada fora da plataforma principal, através de processos independentes, transparentes e verificáveis, cujo objetivo é distribuir recompensas promocionais em MXI sem que isso constitua um jogo de azar regulado.

Os usuários aceitam que as recompensas concedidas são promocionais, digitais e sem valor comercial, e que a participação em qualquer dinâmica não garante ganhos econômicos reais.

---

**IMPORTANTE**: Estes termos e condições são legalmente vinculativos. Se você não concordar com qualquer parte, não deve usar o Aplicativo. É recomendável consultar um consultor legal ou financeiro antes de fazer investimentos em criptomoedas.

    vestingDiarioIntro: 'O Vesting Diário é um mecanismo projetado para proteger a estabilidade do projeto durante a pré-venda e, ao mesmo tempo, fornecer aos investidores uma forma justa, previsível e sustentável de receber seus tokens. Em vez de liberar todos os tokens imediatamente—o que geralmente gera quedas drásticas devido a vendas massivas—MXI distribui as alocações de forma progressiva, equilibrada e transparente.',
    vestingDiarioHowItWorks: 'Desde o momento em que um usuário adquire MXI na pré-venda, seu saldo total é registrado em um contrato inteligente que gerencia a liberação diária. A cada 24 horas, uma porcentagem predefinida do total comprado é liberada automaticamente, permitindo ao usuário retirá-la, transferi-la ou usá-la dentro do ecossistema. Este processo garante que todos os participantes tenham acesso gradual aos seus tokens sem saturar o mercado, enquanto o projeto avança em desenvolvimento, crescimento de usuários, integração de serviços financeiros e expansão do ecossistema.',
    vestingDiarioBenefits: 'O objetivo é criar um equilíbrio natural entre oferta e demanda, o que fortalece a valorização do token e beneficia os primeiros investidores com um modelo sustentável.',
    vestingDiarioTransparency: 'Além disso, o vesting diário é parte do compromisso da MXI com a transparência: cada liberação pode ser auditada na blockchain, e os usuários mantêm o controle total sobre seu fluxo de tokens sem depender de intermediários.',

    // Risks Tab Content - NEW CONTENT
    risksIntro: 'Investir em MXI representa uma oportunidade inovadora dentro de um ecossistema projetado para o crescimento real, mas também envolve riscos prejudiciais que todo investidor deve considerar de forma responsável. MXI promove a transparência, por isso detalhamos os fatores-chave que podem influenciar a rentabilidade presente e futura do projeto.',
    risk1Title: '1. Risco de Volatilidade do Mercado',
    risk1Description: 'O mercado cripto é altamente volátil. Embora o MXI integre um modelo tokenômico híbrido que busca estabilidade através de vesting diário, mecanismos de liquidez e recompensas escaláveis, o preço pode flutuar significativamente devido a condições globais, sentimento do mercado ou eventos inesperados. O valor projetado de lançamento (3 USDT) é uma estimativa, não uma garantia.',
    risk2Title: '2. Risco Tecnológico',
    risk2Description: 'Apesar de o MXI incorporar segurança quântica pós-quântica e arquitetura avançada, nenhum ecossistema digital está completamente livre de vulnerabilidades. Falhas em protocolos, ataques externos ou novas ameaças tecnológicas poderiam afetar a operacionalidade. A implementação quântica minimiza cenários futuros, mas não elimina os riscos 100%.',
    risk3Title: '3. Risco de Execução do Projeto',
    risk3Description: 'MXI está em fase de prevenção e, como todo projeto em desenvolvimento, depende da execução correta do plano técnico, dos tempos de implementação, da adoção comunitária e da consolidação de alianças estratégicas. Atrasos ou reestruturações podem impactar metas e projeções.',
    risk4Title: '4. Risco Regulatório',
    risk4Description: 'O ambiente regulatório global em relação aos criptoativos está mudando. Mudanças nas leis de países-chave, maiores exigências de conformidade ou restrições a exchanges podem influenciar a liquidez, acessibilidade ou preço do token.',
    risk5Title: '5. Risco de Liquidez',
    risk5Description: 'Embora o MXI integre um modelo de liquidez progressivo e ferramentas que incentivam a retenção (vesting diário, recompensas, referências), nas fases iniciais a liquidez pode ser limitada. Isso poderia dificultar vendas imediatas ao preço desejado.',
    risk6Title: '6. Risco de Adoção do Ecossistema',
    risk6Description: 'O potencial do MXI cresce à medida que a comunidade se fortalece e o uso dentro do ecossistema aumenta (cartão, créditos, ferramentas para empreendedores, Marketplaces, Launchpad, energia, expansão global, etc.). Uma adoção mais lenta poderia prolongar os tempos de apreciação do token.',
    risk7Title: '7. Risco Competitivo',
    risk7Description: 'MXI compete em um mercado onde existem projetos altamente posicionados (BTC, ETH, SOL, ADA). Embora o modelo híbrido, o vesting dinâmico e a segurança quântica representem vantagens diferenciais, os avanços dos concorrentes poderiam afetar a participação de mercado potencial.',
    risk8Title: '8. Risco de Dependência Comunitária',
    risk8Description: 'MXI se baseia em um princípio fundamental: se a comunidade cresce, todos crescem. Isso significa que parte do sucesso depende da participação, compromisso e expansão de usuários, emissores de projetos, empreendedores e investidores. A baixa participação limitaria as projeções globais.',
    risk9Title: '9. Risco de Investimento Antecipado',
    risk9Description: 'Como em toda prevenção, os investidores adquirem o token antes que o ecossistema esteja completamente implantado. Embora isso ofereça vantagens de preço (0.04 / 0.07 / 0.10 USDT), também traz a incerteza natural das fases iniciais.',
